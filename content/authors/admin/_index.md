I am a research scientist in AI.
Before that, I was a PhD student at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/), supervised by [Robert M. Gower](https://gowerrobert.github.io/), and then worked at Sony AI in the Privacy-Preserving Machine Learning team.
<!-- [Sony AI blog posts](https://ai.sony/blog/blog-035/). -->

I try to **code efficient and reproducible experiments** through tested open source codes.
I developed the Python open source package **[RidgeSketch](https://github.com/facebookresearch/RidgeSketch)** (with FAIR New York).
I also contributed to the Julia suite **[StochOpt](https://github.com/gowerrobert/StochOpt.jl)** and briefly to **[BenchOpt](https://github.com/benchopt/benchOpt)**.
